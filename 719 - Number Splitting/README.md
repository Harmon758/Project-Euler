[Problem 719](https://projecteuler.net/problem=719): Number Splitting
=====================================================================

We define an $S$-number to be a natural number, $n$, that is a perfect square
and its square root can be obtained by splitting the decimal representation of
$n$ into $2$ or more numbers then adding the numbers.

For example, $81$ is an $S$-number because $\sqrt{81} = 8+1$.  
$6724$ is an $S$-number: $\sqrt{6724} = 6+72+4$.  
$8281$ is an $S$-number: $\sqrt{8281} = 8+2+81 = 82+8+1$.  
$9801$ is an $S$-number: $\sqrt{9801}=98+0+1$.

Further we define $T(N)$ to be the sum of all $S$ numbers $n\le N$. You are
given $T(10^4) = 41333$.

Find $T(10^{12})$.
