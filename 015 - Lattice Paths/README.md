[Challenge #15](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler015/problem):
Lattice Paths
=============

Starting in the top left corner of a $2 \times 2$ grid, and only being able to
move to the right and down, there are exactly $6$ routes to the bottom right
corner.

How many such routes are there through a $20 \times 20$ grid?

[ProjectEuler+ Problem Statement](ProjectEuler%2B%20Challenge%20%2315%20Problem%20Statement.pdf)

The Project Euler problem is equivalent to the ProjectEuler+ challenge with
$T = 1$, $N = 20$, $M = 20$, and `MODULO = False`.
