Square Digit Chains
===================

A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a
number to form a new number until it has been seen before.

For example,

```math
\begin{align}
    & 44 \to 32 \to 13 \to 10 \to \mathbf 1 \to \mathbf 1\\
    & 85 \to \mathbf{89} \to 145 \to 42 \to 20 \to 4 \to 16 \to 37 \to 58 \to
      \mathbf{89}
\end{align}
```

Therefore any chain that arrives at $1$ or $89$ will become stuck in an endless
loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive
at $1$ or $89$.

How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at $89$?

[ProjectEuler+ Problem Statement](ProjectEuler%2B%20Challenge%20%2392%20Problem%20Statement.pdf)

The Project Euler problem is equivalent to the ProjectEuler+ challenge with
$K = 7$ and `MODULO = False`.
