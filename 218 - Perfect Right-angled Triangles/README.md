Perfect Right-angled Triangles
==============================

Consider the right angled triangle with sides $a=7$, $b=24$ and $c=25$.
The area of this triangle is $84$, which is divisible by the perfect numbers
$6$ and $28$.  
Moreover it is a primitive right angled triangle as
$\gcd(a,b)=1$ and $\gcd(b,c)=1$.  
Also $c$ is a perfect square.

We will call a right angled triangle perfect if  
-it is a primitive right angled triangle  
-its hypotenuse is a perfect square.

We will call a right angled triangle super-perfect if  
-it is a perfect right angled triangle and  
-its area is a multiple of the perfect numbers $6$ and $28$.

How many perfect right-angled triangles with $c \le 10^{16}$ exist that are not
super-perfect?

[ProjectEuler+ Problem Statement](ProjectEuler%2B%20Challenge%20%23218%20Problem%20Statement.pdf)

The Project Euler problem is equivalent to the ProjectEuler+ challenge with
$q = 1$ and $n = 10^{16}$.
