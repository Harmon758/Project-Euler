[Problem 317](https://projecteuler.net/problem=317): Firecracker
================================================================

A firecracker explodes at a height of $\pu{100 m}$ above level ground. It
breaks into a large number of very small fragments, which move in every
direction; all of them have the same initial velocity of $\pu{20 m/s}$.

We assume that the fragments move without air resistance, in a uniform
gravitational field with $g=\pu{9.81 m/s^2}$.

Find the volume (in $\pu{m^3}$) of the region through which the fragments move
before reaching the ground. 
Give your answer rounded to four decimal places.
