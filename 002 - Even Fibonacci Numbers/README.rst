======================================================
`Problem 2`_ / `Challenge #2`_: Even Fibonacci Numbers
======================================================

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two
terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

    <p align="center">1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</p>

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

The Project Euler problem is equivalent to the ProjectEuler+ challenge with
T = 1 and N = 4 000 000.
