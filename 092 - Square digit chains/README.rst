=====================================================
`Problem 92`_ / `Challenge #92`_: Square digit chains
=====================================================

A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a
number to form a new number until it has been seen before.

For example,

.. raw:: html

    <pre>
        44 → 32 → 13 → 10 → <b>1</b> → <b>1</b>
        85 → <b>89</b> → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → <b>89</b>
    </pre>

Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless
loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive
at 1 or 89.

How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?

The Project Euler problem is equivalent to the ProjectEuler+ challenge with
K = 7.
