[Challenge #4](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler004/problem):
Largest Palindrome Product
==========================

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from
the product of two $2$-digit numbers is $9009 = 91 \times 99$.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two $3$-digit numbers.
