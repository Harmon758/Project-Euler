[Problem 957](https://projecteuler.net/problem=957): Point Genesis
==================================================================

There is a plane on which all points are initially white, except three red
points and two blue points.  
On each day, every line passing through a red point and a blue point is
constructed. Then every white point, where two different such lines meet, turns
blue.

Let $g(n)$ be the maximal possible number of blue points after $n$ days.

For example, $g(1)=8$ and $g(2)=28$.

Find $g(16)$.
