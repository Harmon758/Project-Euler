[Challenge #19](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler019/problem):
Counting Sundays
================

You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research
for yourself.

- 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
- Thirty days has September,  
  April, June and November.  
  All the rest have thirty-one,  
  Saving February alone,  
  Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.  
  And on leap years, twenty-nine.
- A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century
  unless it is divisible by 400.

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century
(1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?

[ProjectEuler+ Problem Statement](ProjectEuler%2B%20Challenge%20%2319%20Problem%20Statement.pdf)

The Project Euler problem is equivalent to the ProjectEuler+ challenge with
$T = 1$, $Y_{1} = 1901$, $M_{1} = 1$, $D_{1} = 1$, $Y_{2} = 2000$,
$M_{2} = 12$, and $D_{2} = 31$.
