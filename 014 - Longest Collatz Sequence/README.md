[Challenge #14](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler014/problem):
Longest Collatz Sequence
========================

The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

- $n \to n/2$ ($n$ is even)
- $n \to 3n + 1$ ($n$ is odd)

Using the rule above and starting with $13$, we generate the following
sequence:

$$13 \to 40 \to 20 \to 10 \to 5 \to 16 \to 8 \to 4 \to 2 \to 1.$$

It can be seen that this sequence (starting at $13$ and finishing at $1$)
contains $10$ terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it
is thought that all starting numbers finish at $1$.

Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?

**NOTE:** Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.

[ProjectEuler+ Problem Statement](ProjectEuler%2B%20Challenge%20%2314%20Problem%20Statement.pdf)

The Project Euler problem is equivalent to the ProjectEuler+ challenge with
$T = 1$ and $`N = 1\,000\,000`$.
