[Problem 836](https://projecteuler.net/problem=836): A Bold Proposition
=======================================================================

Let $A$ be an **affine plane** over a **radically integral local field** $F$
with residual characteristic $p$.

We consider an **open oriented line section** $U$ of $A$ with normalized Haar
measure $m$.

Define $f(m, p)$ as the maximal possible discriminant of the **jacobian**
associated to the **orthogonal kernel embedding** of $U$ into $A$.

Find $f(20230401, 57)$. Give as your answer the concatenation of the first
letters of each bolded word.
