[^1]: Project Euler Problem solved through ProjectEuler+ Challenge code
[^2]: Project Euler Problem solved through ProjectEuler+ Challenge code, with adjustment of constant variable(s)
[^3]: Previously named "Multiples of 3 and 5": https://projecteuler.chat/viewtopic.php?t=7316.
      The ProjectEuler+ Challenge still has this name.
[^4]: Project Euler Problem (Descriptions /) Titles previously did not use title case:
      https://web.archive.org/web/20230528105433/https://projecteuler.net/archives.
      This is still reflected in the ProjectEuler+ Challenge name.
[^5]: The ProjectEuler+ Challenge has a different name: "Number to Words"
