[^3]: Project Euler Problem solved through ProjectEuler+ Challenge code, optionally using the file given as part of the problem
[^4]: No code necessary
[^5]: No corresponding ProjectEuler+ Challenge yet
[^6]: Previously named "Multiples of 3 and 5": https://projecteuler.chat/viewtopic.php?t=7316.
      The ProjectEuler+ Challenge still has this name.
[^7]: Project Euler Problem (Descriptions /) Titles previously did not use title case:
      https://web.archive.org/web/20230528105433/https://projecteuler.net/archives.
      This is still reflected in the ProjectEuler+ Challenge name.
[^8]: The ProjectEuler+ Challenge has a different name: "Number to Words"
