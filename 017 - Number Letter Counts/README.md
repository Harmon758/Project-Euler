[Problem 17](https://projecteuler.net/problem=17): Number Letter Counts /
[Challenge #17](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler017/problem):
Number to Words
===============

If the numbers $1$ to $5$ are written out in words: one, two, three, four,
five, then there are $3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19$ letters used in total.

If all the numbers from $1$ to $1000$ (one thousand) inclusive were written out
in words, how many letters would be used?

<br>

**NOTE:** Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, $342$ (three hundred and
forty-two) contains $23$ letters and $115$ (one hundred and fifteen) contains
$20$ letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with
British usage.

[ProjectEuler+ Problem Statement](ProjectEuler%2B%20Challenge%20%2317%20Problem%20Statement.pdf)

The Project Euler problem is equivalent to the ProjectEuler+ challenge with
$T = 1$, $N = 1000$, `INCLUDE_AND = True`, and
`OUTPUT_1_TO_N_LETTER_COUNT = True`, optionally with `SCALE_LIMIT = 1000`.
