[Challenge #67](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler067/problem):
Maximum Path Sum II
===================

By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on
the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

<p align="center">
    ${\color{red}\textbf{3}}$<br>
    ${\color{red}\textbf{7}}$ 4<br>
    2 ${\color{red}\textbf{4}}$ 6<br>
    8 5 ${\color{red}\textbf{9}}$ 3
</p>

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom in
[triangle.txt](0067_triangle.txt?raw=true) (right click and 'Save Link/Target
As...'), a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.

[ProjectEuler+ Problem Statement](ProjectEuler%2B%20Challenge%20%2367%20Problem%20Statement.pdf)

The Project Euler problem is equivalent to the ProjectEuler+ challenge with
$T = 1$, $N = 100$, and the triangle given in the file as part of the problem.
